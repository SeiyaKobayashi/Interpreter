## About This Project

Following the streamlined tutorial written in [Writing An Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com), 
I'm adding some adjustments (some flavors!!) to it, so that it'll be able to interpret an actual programming 
language like Python.

## How To Run

Within Interpreter folder, type in...

```$ go run main.go```

You can also test your test code.

```$ go test```
